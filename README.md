The customer will be prompted if they would like to withdraw now or for later.
If it’s set for later, the pre configured value will appear on the login page for easy access.

If it’s for now, the same cardless authentication, which uses QR scanner is then used to authenticate the customer and then cash will be dispensed through a fast and seamless experience.

Banking Assistant,
Users are able to ask enquiries, such as information regarding the application, and the chatbot would try its best to answer it.

And for the
ATM Locator,
After clicking on get Atm Locations, the nearest ATMs would be marked on the Map, and if the ATM is unavailable, such as the ATM is having maintenance, it the marker would turn red.
